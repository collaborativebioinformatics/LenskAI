# LenskAI

"Lenski-esque AI competition trials with validated assertion databases"

# Aim

The aim of the project is to examine how graph neural networks learn and provide valuable insights from a network-type of data. We plan to feed a graph neural network (GNN) with a large biological network (e.g., DisGeNET, PrimeKG, SPOKE, petagraph). Then change the network architecture and compete both networks agains each other to examine how GNN evolve.

Interesting use cases:
- background effects (secondary genes)
- subtyping of AD -> how many subtypes are there? 
- disease phenotype networks
