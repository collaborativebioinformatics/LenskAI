# Literature-based Validation of Top Prioritized Genes
*A detailed literature analysis of some of the top predicted genes associated with LUAD from the SGConv model. **Genes in bold** indicate that the result was predicted with the MLP model.*

| Rank | Gene | Gene functional description and Literature review |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 2 | `CDC42` | This gene encodes a member of the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and plays a key role in cancer cell migration and metastasis. [Consortium, 2020, Al Haddad et al., 2020] found decreased levels of StarD13, a surpressor of CDC42, in lung tumor tissue and A549 cells subsequently leading to increased CDC42 activation thus increasing formation of invadopodia, a unique hallmark of cancer, and matrix degradation. |
| 3 | `PTPRC` | This gene encodes a tyrosine-protein phosphatase required for T-cell activation. Upon T-cell activation, PTPRC recruits and ephosphorylates FYN which has been shown to be correlated with LUAD by [Consortium, 2020]. [Wei et al., 2021] directly supports PTPRC association with LUAD by demonstrating that PTPRC was a key gene in affecting the immune state of the tumor microenvironment and was ultimately correlated with a variety of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. |
| 4 | `LRRK2` | In an analysis of TCGA LUAD RNA-seq data, [Lebovitz et al., 2021] identified that decreased LRRK2 expression is associated with LUAD. In [Lebovitz et al., 2015], reduced LRRK2 expression was found to promote LUAD tumorigenesis and was associated with poor survival outcomes. This study also found overactivity in LRRK2 contributes to Parkinson’s disease, which suggests pathological links between neurodegenerative disease and cancer are emerging. |
| 5 | `CREB1` | This gene encodes a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that stimulates transcription upon binding to DNA cAMP response element (CRE) [Consortium, 2020]. [Wang et al., 2021a] used protein expression assays to understand the underlying mechanism of ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death associated with cancer, in LUAD. They found that CREB was highly expressed in LUAD and knockdown of CREB inhibited cell viability and growth by promoting apoptosis- and ferroptosis-like cell death. |
| 8 | `ISG15` | ISG15 acts as a cytokine, modulating immune responses, and can delay tumor cell growth by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. [Quet al., 2020] found that high expression of ISG15 serves as a positive prognostic marker for long-term survival in LUAD patients. ISG15 has a broad network of protein targets, and [Yoo et al., 2018] concludes that covalent ISG15 conjugation enhances the tumor-suppressive activity of the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), thereby showing an antitumor effect of Type 1 interferon. |
| 9 | `FYN` | FYN encodes a tyrosine-protein kinase essential in cell motility and adhension and plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT pathway responsible for regulating the cell cycle [Consortium, 2020]. [Xue et al., 2020] demonstrated that overexpression of FYN accelerated cell apoptosis and reduced both angiogensis capacity and PI3K/AKT expression levels in lung carcinoma A549 cells. Conversely, FYN expression was shown to be correlated with LUAD prognosis as FYN expression levels were shown to be downregulated in LUAD tissues and cells. |
| 10 | `ITGB1` | ITGB1 encodes the Integrin beta-1 subunit which when associated with Integrin alpha-3 provides a docking site for FAP, a serine protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tumor growth, at invadopodia plasma membranes. Hence ITGB1 may participate in formation of invadopodia, matrix degradation, and can promote cell invasion [Consortium, 2020]. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that the ITGB1-DT/ARNTL2 axis may effect the progression of LUAD and the immune microenvironment [Qiu et al., 2021]. |
| ***4800**** | **`FTL`** | A study published in 2021 demonstrated a negative correlation between high expression of FTL or LUAD malignancy and a decrease in lipid peroxidation and labile [Wang et al., 2021b]. In an RNA-sequencing study, FTL and FTH1 expression levels were significantly positively correlated with tumor infiltration by tumor-associated macrophages and T regulatory cells [Lucchetta et al., 2019]. Ferritin light chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) were compared and FTL subunits had higher expression levels for LUAD than its heavy chain iron counterpart. FTL also had higher expression for tumorous tissues in most types of cancer, and LUAD showed higher levels of expression and tumor tissue (in comparison to other subtypes of cancer) for the FTL experiment [Lucchetta et al., 2019]. |
| ***12626**** | **`TFF3`** | It is involved in the maintenance and repair of the intestinal mucosa. It also promotes the mobility of epithelial cells during healing [Consortium, 2020]. The highest classified gene from the MLP node-only model is TFF3. This gene was excluded from the training set because it had a GDA score of 0.01, but an association has already been detected by DisGeNet. In 2021, for the first time it was shown that TFF3 was associated with sub diseases of LUAD and was specifically associated with LUAD invasiveness [Luo et al., 2020]. In 2019, TFF3 was identified as a biomarker to be able to distinguish between LUAD and lung squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) [Wang et al., 2015]. In [Wang et al., 2015], over 90% of LUAD was observed to be TFF3 positive, whereas no TFF3 expression was observed in cases of SCC, suggesting TFF3 is an insightful biomarker that enables experts to distinguish and diagnose subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). |
