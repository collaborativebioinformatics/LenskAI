### Description:
“In this image from a genetically engineered mouse model, lung cancer driven by the Kras oncogene shows up in purple. As a key driver in many types of cancer, the Kras gene makes a promising target for new cancer therapies.” [[1]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10549)

### Notes on KRAS:
KRAS mutations are detected in between 25-30% of LUAD, with most of the mutations occurring at codon 12 or 13.

Codon 12 has been associated with worse outcomes than the codon 13 in KRAS mutations and other specific point mutations like those in G12V and G12R. [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479120/#:~:text=KRAS%20mutation%20and%20survival&text=The%20median%20overall%20survival%20for,CI%201.2%2D1.4%20years) As mentioned above, the KRAS gene shows potential for cancer therapies. In May 2021, the FDA approved the first targeted therapy for NSCLC cases with KRAS mutations.

## Title: [Lung Cancer Autophagy](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10545) 

#### This image was originally submitted as part of the 2016 NCI Cancer Close Up project and selected for exhibit. [[5]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10545)

### Description:
“Autophagy represents a cell's response to chemotherapy and radiation that may be one component of resistance to therapy. H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells were exposed to the antitumor drug, etoposide. The image shows the H460 cells (in green) containing acidic autophagic vauoles (orange) that are extranuclear. The small bright green bodies are likely to be micronuclei.” [[5]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10545)

### Notes on Autophagy:
The processes of autophagy and apoptosis are crucial in the pathophysiology of NSCLC and LUAD in particular, as it accounts for between 40-70% of all NSCLC. [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25712477/) Generally, the inhibition of autophagy limits the ability of cells to overcome stress and maintain homeostasis, but it can also promote cell death when inhibited by oncoproteins such as AKT, PI3K, Bcl-1 and mutant p53. [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25712477/) Moreover, autophagy functions as a double-edged sword in carcinogenesis. [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25712477/)


## Title: [Non-Small Lung Cancer After Cisplatin Treatment](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10549)

#### This image was originally submitted as part of the 2016 NCI Cancer Close Up project and selected for exhibit. [[7]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10549)

### Description:
“H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells were exposed to the antitumor drug, cisplatin after autophagy inhibition. The image shows the H460 cells (in green) showing changed staining intensity after inhibition of autophagy. The small bright green bodies are likely to be micronuclei. Autophagy represents a response to chemotherapy and radiation that may be one component of resistance to therapy." [[7]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10549)

### Notes on H460:
In an Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on cytometry data on A549 and H460 cells, [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28408844/) determined H460 cells are a faster growing cell line, growing at almost twice the rate of A549 cells. [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28408844/) concluded hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression on the surface of non-small-cell lung cancer cells, including those of H460, may directly correspond to cell proliferation. (P<0.0001.)


## Title: [Non-Small Lung Cancer After Etoposide Treatment](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10542) 

#### This image was originally submitted as part of the 2016 NCI Cancer Close Up project and selected for exhibit. [[9]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10542)

![nci-vol-10542-72](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85202161/152072412-8ea06ad7-c034-4b24-9b88-6fd193f74aa3.jpg)


### Description:
“H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells were exposed to the antitumor drug, etoposide. The image shows the H460 cells (in green) containing orange (acidic) auto phagic vauoles that are extranuclear. The small bright green bodies are likely to be micronuclei. Autophagy represents a response to chemotherapy and radiation that may be one component of resistance to therapy.” [[9]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10542)


## Title: [Lung Cancer Desmoplasia](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10576)

#### This image was originally submitted as part of the 2016 NCI Cancer Close Up project and selected for exhibit. [[10]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10576)

![nci-vol-10576-150](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85202161/152072430-6b6b39e8-4670-4fb3-98c4-be22235f482d.jpg)


### Description:
“As shown here, lung cancer is associated with a vast stromal desmoplastic reaction (the "neighborhood") in which the connective tissue, associated with the tumor, thickens similarly to scars. Cancer is in red; cell nuclei in cyan; stroma/desmoplasia in green; and an active stroma-specific marker in purple.”[[10]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10576)

### Notes on Desmoplasia:
In [[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458340/), the association between desmoplasia and the risk of relapse was found to be stronger in the LUAD subgroup (n=116) than the NSCLC group (n=165) and High Desmoplasia tumors had significantly higher rate of relapse than those with Low Desmoplasia (HR = 2.45; P value = .011).

## Title: [Lung Cancer Metastasis](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10578)

#### This image was originally submitted as part of the 2016 NCI Cancer Close Up project. [[12]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10578)

![nci-vol-10578-72](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85202161/152072481-2ce1d2fc-b096-4ceb-8247-9d27bcb13da6.jpg)


### Description:
“This image shows how lung cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and start to spread (metastasis). These lung cancer cells have a mutation of a gene called LKB1 (in green) that promotes invasion. Actin, a cytoskeletal protein, is in red, and the cell nucleus is blue. These H157 lung cancer cells are expressing a GFP-tagged piece of LKB1 to disrupt its normal function. Spheroids of these cells were embedded in a 3-D collagen matrix with cells invading for 24 hours.” [[12]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10578)


### Notes on Metastatis:
LKB1 mutates in 20-30% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and evidence suggests it is a primary driver of Metastatis. [[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995373/#:~:text=The%20tumor%20suppressor%20LKB1%20is,in%20NSCLC%2C%20especially%20NSCLC%20metastasis.) Metastatis is a large reason why the survival rate of NSCLC is merely 5 years.  Ultimately, LKB1 is a tumor suppressor and ranks as the 3rd highest mutated gene in LUAD after p53 and Ras. The expression of H157 in the above image, however, may be an indication of lung squamous cell carcinoma. [[14]](https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/CVCL_0463)


## Title: [Migrating Lung Cancer Cells](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10604)

### Description:
"A differential interference contrast image illustrating the aggressive shape of live, migrating non-small cell lung cancer cells. Therapies that are able to stop the migration of tumor cells can help stem or prevent the spread of cancer (metastasis)." [[15]](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=10604)


### Notes on Metastatis:
LKB1 mutates in 20-30% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and evidence suggests it is a primary driver of Metastatis, which is a strong reason why the survival rate of NSCLC is merely 5 years.
